                    Thaddeus' childhood was a privileged one, and yet still a lonely one despite being surrounded by hired hands and various professionals from different fields. His father, Arthur, was an accomplished naval officer and very seldom had interest in Thaddeus or his twin sister Ambrose. Arthur increasingly left the estate as the twins were barely coming of age, continually voyaging out to sea for, what the twins would assume, furthering his career amongst the navy. This caused a deep-rooted need to seek out his father, as he never had the chance to explore fatherly affection. At least, he was not able to truly explore the notion, though Thaddeus did have a sort of pseudo experience with his weapons' master. Thaddeus loved to train and hone his control of the blade, and it was among the various crafts that he dedicated himself in mastering. His weapons' master, Joseph McBane, was the only male figure in Thaddeus' life, and he instinctively latched onto that relationship. However, with time even this relationship failed to satiate Thaddeus' need for his father. And so, Thaddeus Pendragon comes to terms with a newly developing desire to join the navy and become an exemplary naval officer. Thaddeus saw this as a means to direct his energy and ambition, though deep within his subconscious, perhaps, was a necessitous desire to seek out his father.

                    A lonely existence indeed was Thaddeus' life, though he did take much solace in one friend he made during his early years. Fletcher, was his name, a simple boy- a commoner of Waleden. The boys first met near a seaside den where both boys loved to venture off to and cast their gaze unto the horizon, at a deep blue sea that seemingly never ended. It was there these two boys began their quest to embark on a journey across the sea. Thaddeus took a keen interest in Fletcher, who had passion for some similar things as him, and enabled Fletcher to join him in the Pendragon library on many occasions to study. Fletcher was enraptured by the notion for many years, though with time he grew envious of Thaddeus. For it was Thaddeus' doing that allowed Fletcher to get an education, through the noble's bidding that permitted Fletcher to become something he may have never been fated to become. These feelings began to eat away at Fletcher's heart and his attitude toward Thaddeus steadily declined with the passing years.

                    Born and raised within the embrace of the Sarkonos Empire, Thaddeus, an aristocratic heir, begins his priming for enlisting into the navy. Waleden began as a fishing town, so to speak, and Thaddeus studied its roots, its history, as he viewed protecting the city, and its denizens, to be his duty as an aristocrat. He viewed his privilege as an obligation to train him for the purpose of protecting those who could not protect themselves.

                    Thaddeus' education began early- as early as 10 years old- and included an extensive list of different fields including, but not limited to, the way of the sword, history, military tactics, naval engineering, navigation, and the arcana. Though he excelled in all of his studies, he did take a special liking to swordplay. It was no secret that Thaddeus longed for a fatherly figure, especially at such a young age, and as he grew passionate about swordplay, he also developed an impermanent fatherly bond with his sword master Joseph Mcbane. Thaddeus was so engrossed in his tutelage and quest to ready himself for joining the navy, that he would seldom seek out the attention of peers. Sometimes going as far as refusing to leave the Pendragon estate, throwing himself into more and more books, or getting in a few hundred more swings of his sword.

                    An eager Thaddeus applied to Waleden's Navy as young as age thirteen, and was happily welcomed aboard a training vessel to train as a cadet. Much of the knowledge the cadets were being instructed on had already been accrued by Thaddeus, as he took a keen interest in any, and all, things related to the Navy and was sure to read up on those subjects. The officers in charge of training the cadets aboard the ship naturally took a liking to young Thaddeus' enthusiasm for soaking in all the knowledge they had to offer. The officers' fondness of Thaddeus came with heavy recommendations upon his convocation and was quickly assigned to a new ship as a prominent Seaboy to continue his education and training at age fifteen.

                    Thaddeus' exhileration was nearly palpable, and his seniors would come to sense this immediately. He took to his new vessel promptly and leapt through each metaphorical hoop, so to speak, in an effort to catapult himself through the ranks of the Navy. Though it is true that Thaddeus' passion for seafaring was compelling, it could also be a veracious account of Thaddeus seeking out his father, Arthur, in an effort to prove himself worthy of the Pendragon name. Thaddeus spent the next three years displaying his adroitness and expertise of swordplay, and dedicated much of his time honing his skills. The officers appreciation of Thaddeus' dedication to his blade inspired the decision of awarding him the rank of Senior Petty upon coming of age. And so, as Thaddeus became eighteen years old, and a full fledged Naval officer, was promoted to the rank of Master at Arms.
