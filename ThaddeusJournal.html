                        Have I died? My body feels... numb. Try calling out for help. Nothing. I can't even move my fingers. It's so quiet. How much time has passed since I've been enveloped in this silence? My mind is amiss. How did I come to be here? The last thing I can remember was thinking about my dear sister Ambrose. Feeling like I would never be able to see her again. But why? Why wouldn't I be able to see her again?

                        The ship! We were ambushed... There was a traitor amongst us! What was his name? The answer nimbly balances itself on the tip of my tongue and I cannot speak his name! Why? Who was the traitor?! The turncoat will wreap what he has sowed, and face the consequences for his actions! 
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: white;">
                        Fletcher? But why? After all these years we've spent together preparing for our adventures? For the Navy... How did I miss this? I was the closest to him than any other on that ship. How could I have missed this?! Think Thaddeus, think! You must have seen this coming. Fletcher must have left us clues. If I weren't blinded by our bond I may have been able to save my unit. If I survive this, Fletcher, I vow to bring you to justice if it means dragging you into the cells of Waleden's dungeons myself!

                        Time continues, surely. Though I cannot be sure how much time. My thoughts run amok and the silence continues to persist. I keep searching for answers and looking for clues and yet I remain in this dispicable state.

                        A broken Thaddeus gradually emerges from an unconscious state to the unremitting sound of water droplets crashing into a small puddle. It takes him a moment to adjust his eyes to the dimly lit surrounding he's beginning to find himself in. With some time and effort, he regains control of his fingers. As he cast his fingers across the surface beneath him he feels cold, hard stone. Then, images of the previous nights' dream manifest before him, revealing a man made seemingly of shadow with his palm outstretched. Clasped within this stranger's palm is a key. Visions of attempts in obtaining this key ending in failure flicker in Thaddeus' mind's eye, almost tauntingly. Then as sudden as it all began, Thaddeus realizes he's still dreaming and is suddenly plunged into a depth of an endless, black sea of void gleaming with a soft, purple hue.

                    <p style="color: white;">
                        Thaddeus emerges from his slumber to the sound of a woman barking orders. Through conversing with this woman he learns she is in fact the Queen Regnant of Khar. The Red Queen devilishly explains that Thaddeus and his sister dearest, Ambrose, had been poisoned with a potentially fatal venom designed by her magi. This poison, if left untreated, will kill the twins in two weeks. Thaddeus and Ambrose are instructed to locate a missing Prince Jawlin, and in return will be granted their freedom as well as an antidote for the affliction inflicted unto them by the Red Queen's magi. A drunkard named Phil has also been instructed to assist the twins in this endeavour.
