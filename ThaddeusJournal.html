                        Have I died? My body feels... numb. Try calling out for help. Nothing. I can't even move my fingers. It's so quiet. How much time has passed since I've been enveloped in this silence? My mind is amiss. How did I come to be here? The last thing I can remember was thinking about my dear sister Ambrose. Feeling like I would never be able to see her again. But why? Why wouldn't I be able to see her again? 
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: white;">
                        The ship! We were ambushed... There was a traitor amongst us! What was his name? The answer nimbly balances itself on the tip of my tongue and I cannot speak his name! Why? Who was the traitor?! The turncoat will wreap what he has sowed, and face the consequences for his actions! 
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: white;">
                        Fletcher? But why? After all these years we've spent together preparing for our adventures? For the Navy... How did I miss this? I was the closest to him than any other on that ship. How could I have missed this?! Think Thaddeus, think! You must have seen this coming. Fletcher must have left us clues. If I weren't blinded by our bond I may have been able to save my unit. If I survive this, Fletcher, I vow to bring you to justice if it means dragging you into the cells of Waleden's dungeons myself!

                        Time continues, surely. Though I cannot be sure how much time. My thoughts run amok and the silence continues to persist. I keep searching for answers and looking for clues and yet I remain in this dispicable state.
